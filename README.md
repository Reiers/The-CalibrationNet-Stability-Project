## About the Project
The CalibrationNet Stability Project boosts Filecoin ecosystem reliability by enhancing CalibrationNet’s capacity to support blockchain testing, upgrade validations, and SP (Storage Provider) technology advancements. By leveraging batch sealing, fast snap deals, and a CalibrationNet-optimized Boost, the Curio and TechX teams achieved a significant Quality Adjusted Power (QAP) increase—adding hundreds of TiBs in just 12 hours with five available machines.

## Contributions and Impact

### Project Contributions
The CalibrationNet Stability Project is essential for Storage Providers, developers, and ecosystem contributors seeking a stable and efficient test environment. By reinforcing CalibrationNet, the project addresses critical infrastructure dependencies and facilitates:

- **Consistent and Safe Deployments**: Enhancing the reliability of smart contract testing, upgrade validation, and SP tooling iterations.
- **QAP Expansion**: Hundreds of TiBs added in record time, dramatically strengthening network testing capacity.
- **Calibration Stability Commitment**: We are deliberately maintaining stable calibration nodes to serve as reliable test targets. This allows repeatable, consistent testing across nv (network version) upgrades.
- **Daily Monitoring**: Our team actively monitors all CalibrationNet nodes and participating miners every day to ensure uptime, responsiveness, and rapid reaction to any issues.
- **Upgrade Validation**: We ensure every nv upgrade goes through successfully and is validated on our infrastructure.

### Community & Ecosystem Support
The project helps extend the testing and debugging framework of Filecoin, giving both new and veteran contributors a dependable calibration environment that mirrors mainnet challenges.
