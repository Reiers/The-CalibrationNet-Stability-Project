# CalibrationNet Stability Project

## About the Project
The CalibrationNet Stability Project boosts Filecoin ecosystem reliability by enhancing CalibrationNet’s capacity to support blockchain testing, upgrade validations, and SP technology advancements. By leveraging batch sealing, fast snap, and a CalibrationNet-optimized Boost, the Curio and TechX team achieved a significant Quality Adjusted Power (QAP) increase, adding hundreds of TiBs in just 12 hours with five available machines.
